Cook: **20 min**
Ready In: **1 hr 20 min**

## Ingredients

Measure|Ingredient
---|---
16 oz|Chicken Breast *Boneless, skinless*
1/4 c|Peanut Butter *Smooth*
1 1/2 t|Corriander
1 1/2 t|Salt
1/2 t|Cayenne Pepper
1 t|Ground Cumin
1/2 t|Black Pepper
1 1/2 t|Lemon Juice
1 T|Brown Sugar *Dark*
3 T|Soy Sauce
1/4 t|Garlic *Powdered*
1 T|Onion *Powdered*

## Instructions

1. Mix everything but the chicken in a mixing bowl.
2. Cut the chicken breasts into about 1 inch cubes.
3. Mix the chicken with the other ingredients (I like to do it by mushing it around inside a one gallon, plastic zip-lock bag) and let it marinate for about two hours in the fridge.
4. Stick the chicken cubes on bamboo skewers.
5. Grill until chicken is thoroughly cooked. You can check for this by taking one cube off and splitting it about half way.
