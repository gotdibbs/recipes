Place on parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake on an upper rack for 15-20 minutes until lightly crisped and browned. Note: you can toss the hot sauce in with the batter, just increase flour accordingly.
2. **Succotash**: Add all ingredients to a pan and sautee until fragrant while the cualiflower is cooking.
3. **Spice the cauliflower:** Gently toss the baked cauliflower in a bowl with the hot sauce. Return to pan. Bake for another 5-10 minutes.
4. **Tacos:** Fill each tortilla with succotash, cauliflower, a drizzle of your preferred topping, and cilantro (if you must). Perfection!
