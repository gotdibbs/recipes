Yield: **1 Serving**
Ready In: **15 min**

## Ingredients

Measure|Ingredient
---|---
2 Large|Eggs
1 Medium|Tortilla *I prefer gluten free texture, but whatever works*
To taste|Shredded cheese *I usually use Daiya*
To taste|Sauce of choice, usually salsa verde or frank's hot sauce

## Instructions

1. Whip the eggs in a bowl.
2. Grease a good pan and preheat it on low.
3. Pour the eggs into the pan and cook.
4. Flip the egg after the top loses most of it's runnyness.
5. Immediately add shredded cheese to top of the egg, and then the tortilla.
6. Let sit for a minute or so, then flip again.
7. Brown the tortilla but **do not burn it**. You'll typically start to catch the burnt sent and that's when it's done!
8. Serve the tortilla and add sauce of choice.
