## Instructions

1. Slice bread into as many servings as desired. I generally try to make them no less than 1/2" thick. Place sliced bread on baking pan.
2. Preheat oven to 350°F.
3. Slice cheese into strips about 1/4" thick, and place one slice of cheese on each slice of the bread.
4. On each slice of bread, apply enough olive oil to cover the top and bottom evenly.
5. Apply garlic powder to the top of the bread to taste.
6. Place bread in oven for approximately 5-15 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
